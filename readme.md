# FreeRTOS Linux Port

This repository contains **ONLY** the FreeRTOS Linux port that you can use right away. It doesn't include anything else. 

> **Note**: This port isn't real-time, but you can use it to try and learn about FreeRTOS as fast as possible. Happy tasking!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

I'm neither the owner nor tightly involved in the FreeRTOS project (but I love it!). I'm just packing it for my future self and your convenience, nothing more. 

For any questions about the kernel, ports, memory models, and libraries, please use the [official FreeRTOS forums](https://forums.freertos.org/).
